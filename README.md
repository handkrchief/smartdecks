# SmartDecks Flashcard Web Service API

## Overview

SmartDecks is a basic full-stack flashcard web application. It includes:

- User registration and simple drop-down login
- Deck creation and management
- Flashcard creation, editing, and review mode

The backend is built with Node.js and MySQL, and the frontend is a simple jQuery-based interface.

The project is split into three parts:
- `backend/`: Express-based API for handling all user, deck, and flashcard operations
- `frontend/`: A browser-based interface for interacting with the flashcard system
- `a3.html`: A web page for API documentation of usable routes
